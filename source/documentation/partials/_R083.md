The format of &lt;Follow Up Correlation ID&gt; is defined as per the below structure:  
   
Field / Content / Field type / Examples  
1 / Year / Numeric 2 / "05"  
2 / Identifier of the MS where the message was initially submitted / Alphabetic 2 / “ES”  
3 / Free nationally assigned, code / Alphanumeric 21 / ARC  
4 / Complement / Alphanumeric 3 / "123"  
   
Field 1 is last two digits of year.  
Field 2 is taken from the list of &lt;NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS&gt;.  
Field 3 must be filled with a nationally assigned identifier. In certain case, for the Follow Up Correlation ID it can be an ARC.  
Field 4 gives a complement to field 3 to make together a unique identifier (for example, in the case of Follow Up Correlation ID where several follow-up messages deal with the same ARC).
