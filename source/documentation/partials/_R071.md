## R071
The format of &lt;Event Report Number&gt; is defined as per the below structure:  
   
Field / Content / Field type / Examples  
1 / Identifier of the MS where the report is validated / Alphabetic 2 / "ES"  
2 / Nationally assigned, unique code / Alphanumeric 13 (digits and capital letters) / "2005YTE17UIC2"  
3 / Check Digit / Numeric 1 / "9"  
   
Field 1 is taken from the list of &lt;NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS&gt;  
Field 2 must be filled with a unique identifier per report. The way this field is used is under MSAs" responsibility, but each report must have a unique number. It is possible, but not mandatory, that it contains the year when the report was initially submitted (as suggested in the example).  
Field 3 gives the Check Digit for the whole identifier, that will help detect an error when keying this identifier.
