## R276
For information exchanges from United Kingdom (Northern Ireland) (i.e. Northern Ireland being the sending Member State), the &lt;Status Request Message Type&gt; = "2-Movement History Request" is not allowed.

Note: In the case where more than one of the rules R271 - R276 are applied on a single message, then the corresponding validations should be performed based on a logical 'OR' condition, i.e. if one of the rules is validated successfully, then the message should pass the corresponding validations regarding its relevance to Northern Ireland.
