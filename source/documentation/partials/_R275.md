## R275
For information exchanges from United Kingdom (Northern Ireland), the Follow Up Correlation ID must be related to Northern Ireland (i.e. Member State to be "XI" as derived from its structure).

Note: In the case where more than one of the rules R271 - R276 are applied on a single message, then the corresponding validations should be performed based on a logical 'OR' condition, i.e. if one of the rules is validated successfully, then the message should pass the corresponding validations regarding its relevance to Northern Ireland.
