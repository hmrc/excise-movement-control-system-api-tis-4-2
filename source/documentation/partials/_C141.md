## C141
The total number of &lt;TRADER AUTHORISATION&gt;, &lt;TAX WAREHOUSE&gt;, and &lt;TEMPORARY AUTHORISATION&gt; Data Groups that central SEED disseminates to a MSA should not exceed the upper limit set by the MSA.
If the MSA has set the upper limit to null, then central SEED should not apply a limit on the number of Data Groups.
